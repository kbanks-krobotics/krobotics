First checkin was dated 02/17/2012

Multiple "panels" of the UI existed but were not arranged in any way.

	Ship Status

	Galactic Map (but no highlighting)

	Long Range Scanner

	Short Range Scanner

	Warp Drive Control

	Impulse Engines Control

	LRS Button

	Dock Button

	New Game Button

Enemy ships moved but did not fire.

Torpedos were in the code but apparently did no damage.

Phasers were not in the code yet.

Starbases and docking were in.

Second checkin was dated 02/18/2012

"After torpedo work"

Unexpected side effect - now that the Klingons can shoot back, it is more of a "twitch game" than I anticipated...

(Note - enemy ships not allowed to use diagonal shots)

Enemy ships as powerful as the player ships. So took 4 hits to kill...

UI still not arranged. Still no phasers.
