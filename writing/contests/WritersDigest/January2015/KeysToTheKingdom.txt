"It was just like an artificial intelligence to give a holiday assignment
that was tedious, yet enigmatic" Edgar grumbled to himself.

Tedious because there were over 40 neighboring realities within range.

Enigmatic because S.T.E.F.A.N. had given him no indication of WHAT he was
supposed to be looking for, only the WHEN, WHERE, and DIVERGENCE.

Of course, the bulk of the analysis was being done by subordinate agents,
and Edgar was just trying to make sense of their summaries.

Sighing, he panned randomly from entry to entry, never reading very far into
one before giving up in frustration and jumping to a different one:

<<ARI#23-SUMMARY>>

Mrs. Fisher walks resolutely towards the Science Building and away from her
keys, unaware that they have fallen onto the hard pavement because she is
still wearing her headphones, engrossed in the stirring symphony she has been
listening to all morning...

<<ARI#12-SUMMARY>>

Mrs. Fisher walks confidently away from the discarded keys and towards the
Science Building, happy to have finally come to a decision regarding whether
or not to keep them, along with all they stand for. She knows her husband
will be incensed, and she no longer cares...

<<ARI#37-SUMMARY>>

Miss Fisher walks past the abandoned keys in the parking lot without noticing
their presence, preoccupied as she is with the new symphony she is composing
in her head. Up ahead looms the Music building...


Each summary was accompanied by a single image that had been taken through
the trans-dimensional lens, aimed at the specified coordinates S.T.E.F.A.N. had
provided. Although none of them was fully in focus, the third one was especially
blurry, no suprise given that it was of a dimension more divergent from his own
than the other two, and hence "farther way" in a fifth-dimensional sense.

Realizing he was getting absolutely nowhere, Edgar decided "to hell with
imperative 4" and punched the call button. S.T.E.F.A.N's synthetic voice prompted
immediately, "PROCEED:".

"Stef, we've been poring over this data for days and I see no sign of this
so-called anomaly of yours. I understand you're programmed to 'help humanity grow
by NOT helping humanity TOO much' but WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE LOOKING FOR?"

The pause before S.T.E.F.A.N's answer was actually noticable, which disturbed
Edgar because he knew how fast the quantum mainframe actually was. It indicated
the AI had gone through literally trillions of ethical and legal calculations
before deciding how much information it could responsibly provide to Edgar.

"IGNORE THE DIFFERENCES.
     IGNORE THE SIMILARITIES.
          CONCENTRATE ON THE IDENTICALITIES".

Edgar doubted that last one was even a real word (grammar was not S.T.E.F.A.N.'s
strong suit) but he still pondered the meaning and implications of it.

There were in fact lots of things identical between one Alternate Reality and the
next, and in fact it had often taken months (and in some cases, years) of observation
to determine what the differences were between them. However, there WAS always at
least one divergence, since the lens was unable to focus on its own reality.

The keys were always in focus, but jumbled differently in each reality. They
certainly weren't identical, since there was always at least one key pointing off
in some random direction.

Edgar set the console to cyclic, and watched the individual images pass by in slow
succession. The details varied - sometimes Fisher wore red, sometimes blue, sometimes
slacks, sometimes a dress, and Edgar was convinced that in some of the trans-
dimensional images it was actually a MISTER Fisher instead of a Miss or Mrs.

The keys were always on the pavement, although they appeared to jump around the screen.

A quick gesture and the slow cycle became a rapid blur, but that was no help. Edgar
reset the speed to the original slow pace, and instead changed the positioning so
that the keys were consistently centered in frame.

With the keys centered, it almost reminded Edgar of a clock, as the outward-pointing
keys waved around like a dancing lunatic.

Slowly it dawned on him that it was EXACTLY like a clock, he was just watching the
images out-of-order since he had pulled up the files randomly. He twisted the SORT icon.

Now the odd keys marched around in a circle - a circle that matched the Alternate Reality
Index (ARI) of each scan.

With a chill, Edgar realized that not only was someone capable of affecting ALL of the
parallel realities, but their use of the gratuitous "clock code" meant they knew Edgar
was watching - and they didn't care.
